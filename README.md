Products Grid
====

This is an ecommerce site, where you can buy all sorts of ascii faces like `(ノ・∀・)ノ` and `¯_(ツ)_/¯`, in a wide variety of font sizes. The homepage should display a list of products for people to browse.


Features
----

- products are displayed in a grid.
- give the user an option to sort the products in ascending order. Can sort by "size", "price" or "id". The products list should be reloaded when a new sorting option is chosen.
- each product has :
  - a "size" field, which is the font-size (in pixels). We should display the faces in their correct size, to give customers a realistic impression of what they're buying.
  - a "price" field, in cents. This should be formatted as dollars like `$3.51`.
  - a "date" field, which is the date the product was added to the catalog. Dates should be displayed in relative time (eg. "3 days ago") unless they are older than 1 week, in which case the full date should be displayed.
- the product grid should automatically load more items as you scroll down.
- display an animated "loading..." message while the user waits for the data to load.
- to improve the user's experience, we should always pre-emptively fetch the next batch of results in advance, making use of idle-time.  But they still should not be displayed until the user has scrolled to the bottom of the product grid.
- when the user reaches the end and there are no more products to display, show the message "~ end of catalogue ~".

### Ads features

- after every 20 products we need to insert an advertisement from one of our sponsors. Use the same markup as the advertisement in the header shown in `public/index/html`, but make sure the `?r` query param is randomly generated each time an ad is displayed.
- Ads should be randomly selected, but a user must never see the same ad twice in a row.


Products API
----

- The basic query looks like this: `/api/products`
- The response format is JSON.
- To paginate results use the `_page` parameter, eg: `/api/products?_page=10&_limit=15` (returns 15 results starting from the 10th page).
- To sort results use the `_sort` parameter, eg: `/api/products?_sort=price`. Valid sort values are `price`, `size` and `id`.
